In here, you will find work from AP Computer Science and AT Computer Science.
In BlackJack, there is both a general game simulator and a large simulation used for card counting.
In Yahtzee, there is a general game simulator.
Anything committed from AT Computer Science involves college level Data Structures.
There is a lot of other worthwhile code in the source folder "work". You will find
a lot of recursion such as a Sudoku generator, Fractal generator, and also a Towers of Hanoi solution.
I welcome you to look at anything else in this repository! Coding is absolutely my passion and I hope to learn all I can about Comptuer Science.
